# Hardware-timing
C-code to initialize and control a hardware timing device from National Instruments. This code is specifically targeted towards an NI PCI-6602 timing card connected to a modified NI SCB-68 breakout. Please look at the source code in timer_cam_PWC.cpp to figure out the exact terminals or to modify. 

This code was initially designed to synchronize dual head, pulsed lasers and cameras and, as such, is quirky. Use at your own risk.
